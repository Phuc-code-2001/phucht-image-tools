# Diffusers

ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether youâ€™re looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model, ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on usability over performance, simple over easy, and customizability over abstractions.

**The library has three main components**:

- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines for inference with just a few lines of code. There are many pipelines in ðŸ¤— Diffusers, check out the table in the pipeline overview for a complete list of available pipelines and the task they solve.
- Interchangeable noise schedulers for balancing trade-offs between generation speed and quality.
- Pretrained models that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.
